In the linked stored of Good Citizens Need Not Fear you'll find a Beach Boys album recorded onto an x-ray of pneumonia infected lungs, a mummified saint on display in a delicatessen case, and a number of other ingeniously crafted artifacts so perfectly strange that it becomes impossible to determine if they are pulled from history or flawlessly delivered absurdities.

These colorful objects stand in sharp contrast to the bleak society they inhabit: a remote city in Ukraine in the years just before and after the fall of the Soviet Union. Frustration and paranoia are the bread and butter of a people whose lives have been governed by a sprawling bureaucracy that has spread its nightmarish illogic into all aspects of the life.

The citizens, despite their dismal circumstances, are teeming with lifeâ€”ambiguous friendships emerge through schemes to make money on the black-market, a town celebrates when a beauty pageant contestant spits in the face of a judge. Fallible and disoriented as they are, the characters display resiliency as they clumsily attempt to exercise sovereignty in the grips of poverty and a dysfunctional system.

The good citizens suggest that even in less than ideal conditions, we can still define our lives through the meaning we give, relationships we keep, and choices we make.
