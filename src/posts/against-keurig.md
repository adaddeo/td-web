I remember the first time I used a Keurig. It was magic.

I was around 16 years old and didn't actually know how to make coffee. I was on vacation with my parents and we we're staying with some of their friends in Cape Cod. They had a Keurig and showed me how to use it. I woke up very early the next day, made a cup of coffee that was the first cup I'd ever made from "k-cup" labeled Nantucket Blend, and went to the beach to watch the sunrise. It was a memorable cup.

My highly impressionable teenage brain was quite impressed. A Keurig was one of the first purchases I made when I was living on my own. It faithfully brewed me hundreds of coffees, all with cleanup as simple as tossing away one small cup.

Fast forward a decade. My Keurig is long gone. What happened? Over those years I slowly came to a series of realizations about the device:

* The coffee it makes is mediocre.
* The machine is unplesant to look at.
* The machine is relatively expensive.
* The machine makes unpleasant sounds.
* The machine takes up space on the counter.
* The "k-cups" generate hard-to recycle plastic waste.
* I couldn't buy coffee but only specialized "k-cups".
* The machine requires descaling every 3 to 6 months.

It's a piece of technology that offers you convenience for the cost of quality, sustainability, aesthetics, space and time (through the proxy of money). When did we start to stretch of ourselves so thin that this became an enticing trade-off?

Here's the underlying insight: _problems of the modernity are problems of our own invention._

We work a job to make money to buy a car to drive to that job to make money to pay for gas and car insurance and car payments and tires and oil changes and maintenance and parking so we can keep driving to keep making money. It's a simplification but there's a kernel of truth.

We started to optimize the world, a fine thing in itself. We created solutions, each bringing a new set of problems to solve, to solve our problems. And then we introduced a solutoins with a new set of problems to solve those meta-problems. And on and on we go. The "modernity problem" I'm suggesting arises when it becomes hard to keep sight on which are the real problems and which are the meta-problems. Furthermore, dependencies form between the problems and it's no longer easy to unwind anything. Our lives become a giant Rube Goldberg machine.

Sometimes there is a way out.

### How I make coffee now

[I make pour-over coffee using a Chemex.](/coffee) The method is simple: pour near-boiling water over ground coffee. All you need outside of the raw ingredients is a method of heating water, a filter, and a funnel.

I use the Chemex because I like the way it looks but you can achieve the same quality coffee with any funnel.

It takes about 8 minutes, 4 to heat the water and 4 to brew, instead of the 3 minutes it takes for a Keurig. It takes 1 minute to rinse the glass instead of the 5 seconds to throw away the k-cup.

I try to see the extra time as a feature not a bug. A tiny ritual to enjoy. No looking at my phone. Smell the coffee. Stand up straight. Breath. Be in the here and now for a few minutes. I have the rest of my day for machines and slouching.

### Note to Self

I'm adding this section as a remembrance to myself to not be hip or smug. Keurigs are fine. I used one for many years and loved it. There are plenty of places in my life where someone could point out a better way (in accordance with their current value system of course) and I would go "yeah I don't care and like my way have fun wasting your precious thoughts on that inconsequential detail", and we'd both be justified.
