Eating out
  + try new things
  + socialize
  + experience someones craft
  - expensive
  - passive

Cooking in
  + try new things
  + socialize
  + cheaper (spend the saved money on wine)
  + active

Not to be romantic about it but it does feel like simple pleasures and
efficiencies like this are lost in our highly atomized society. In the
past it seems that more people at together, whether it be a communal
or multi-generational family setting.

What stories do you have of eating growing up?
