On Chapin's journey to pursue his obsessive passion, his mentor and chess
grandmaster Ben Finegold often quips, "the truth hurts", and indeed as Chapin's
overwhelming love for chess bumps up with the cold, ambivalent reality of both
the game and his life, Chapin is forced to wrestle with some profound but
painful truths.

The writing is intelligent and often hilarious, and in it Chapin bares his
naiveties, insecurities, and deepest desires in full, giving us an honest
account of the mixture of hope, anxiety, elation, and disappointment he
experiences in his quest for meaning and greatness. 

Throughout the narrative Chapin gives a gripping and personal exposition of the
game, from its austere beauty to its singular significance as a human endeavor.
In chess, Chapin sees a simple yet combinatorially infinite world of "perfect
information" free from the ambiguities and bullshit that plague life. This
brutal honesty is a paradox for Chapin as it's what both attracts him to the
game but also painfully exposes his familiar tendency to idealize life.

Though Chapin never reaches the heights of chess glory he dreamed of at the
outset of his journey, he triumphs in a more human and profound way as he comes
to understand an enigmatic, koan-like secret of the game, and just maybe his
life.
