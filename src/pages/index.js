        This thread started for me at the beginning of 2020 when I read Simon Sarris's
        {' '}
        <a href="https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41">
          Designing a New Old Home
        </a>
        {' '}.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more I've seen about the field the more interested I am. I'm even considering
        if I should get a Masters in Architecture and move into the field entirely.
