          This thread started for me at the beginning of 2020 when I read Simon
          Sarris's{" "}

          The more I've seen about the field the more interested I am. I'm even
          considering if I should get a Masters in Architecture and move into
          the field entirely.

          There was a time when I was up on the Austin restaurant scene but
          since I haven't had stable income in a while I rarely eat out these
          days. This would count as a loss, as sharing a nice meal out with
          friends is a favorite activity of mine, if it wasn't the case that
          sharing a nice meal in with friends is at least as good!
        </p>

        <p>
          It feels great when things shift in life from labeled activities (i.e.
          dinner party) to part of the fabric of life. Wife and I have reached
          this point with shared meals at home with friends. It's the perfect
          barbell strategy: one night a week we spend a couple hours cooking an
          grand meal more elaborate than we would do for just the two of us and
          then a few others we just show up with a bottle of wine and enjoy
          being served.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of our friends gave wife and I a cookbook called{" "}
          <span className="italic underline">Vietnamese Food Any Day</span> that
          we've been cooking out of. Everything has been incredibly tasty and
          dishes we hadn't cooked before (
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZGLC53BsmA">
            sizzling rice crepes
          </a>{" "}
          have been a favorite). The author, Andrea Nguyen, did a great job
          making the ingredients and prep times for the recipes approachable.
          Highly recommend!
