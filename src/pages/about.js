    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
      I grew up in Austin, Texas, which is where I live today with my wife and
      two chocolate labs. My parents moved down here from Massachusetts when I
      was two.
    </p>

    <h3 className="mt-6">Boyhood</h3>

    <p>
      I was lucky enough to grow up with loving parents and in a city that was
      growing up around me. My dad took to me to SxSW when I was 6 and I
      remember my high school years by who played at Austin City Limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      I mostly wasn't interested in school itself, something I consider a missed opportunity
      and a pattern I'd repeat in college.
    </p>

    <h3 className="mt-6">College</h3>

    <p>
      I attended the University of Texas where I studied computer science in
      the Turing Scholars Program and <a href="/football">played football (walk-on, not scholarship)</a>. As
      sometimes happen to people in college, I spent most of my spare time on
      social activities or reading books completely unrelated to my field
      (mostly classic lit and money). Looking back I do wish I would've
      realized how interesting my actual studies were and invested more time in
      learning with my peers and professors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      During college I interned at Intel as a software developer. The work mostly
      consisted of writing small Perl and Bash scripts. It was great to make some
      money and get real work experience along some quality people but the real
      take-away was figuring out that I was fairly allergic to the corporate
      world.
    </p>

    <h3 className="mt-6">Career</h3>

    <p>
      When I was in school I met wily entrepreneur running an e-commerce wine
      business called Personal Wine (along with a wine bar) out of a basement
      in downtown Austin. I started working for him and helped him grow the
      business with better software and online presence. I had a knack for
      business and eventually became the CEO.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the start of 2018 I left Personal Wine to co-found a company with
      three individuals I had a lot of respect for. Our intention was to build
      a lean, boot-strapped SaaS company.
    </p>

    <p>
      We built a virtual assistant that helped employees take care of internal
      adminstrative tasks, like updating tax forms and enrolling in benefit
      plans. The idea was that each company has a similar set of tasks like this,
      and often times the employee experience is fragmented across many systems.
      Our assistant would provide a single interface and leverage the latest
      NLP technologies to provide a seamless experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a lot of interest in our product and we had some success selling it to a few enterprise customers, but realized that the realities of long sales cycles and complexities in rolling out a tool like this at large organization were incompatible with our plan to build a lean organization. We eventually decided to put the company of ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn't the big exit every entreprenuer dreams of, but it was fun and tremendously valuable experience. I came out of the experience with a sharper toolkit for decision-making at an early-stage company. Since then I've used this experience to provide consulting to early-stage startups.
