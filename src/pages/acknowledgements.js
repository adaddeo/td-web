    <p>
      Almost everything you see on this website was adapted from someone else.
      Usually the someone else is someone I don't know personally. Thank you
      people!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.instinctbodywork.org/">Olga Vilkotskaya</a> for her
        keen eye and invigorating support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.perell.com/">David Perrel</a> for his work on
        writing online. It was some tweet of his that encouraged me to build
        this site.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a> for his highly original
        personal site and his "now page" concept. If authenticity is the new
        cool than Derek's the new Paul Newman.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/">Tom Critchlow</a> for his
        collapsible outline approach to organizing content.

      <li>
        <a href="https://davidklaing.com/">David Klaing</a> for his simple and
        effective home page which served as a great example in many ways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/about/">Venkatesh Rao</a> for his
        domestic cozy concept, an aesthetic trend I've enjoyed following and designing to.
